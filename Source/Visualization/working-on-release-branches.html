            <p>Here are the rules for working on Ethane systems.
            <ol>
                <li>Branches for Ethane Systems <strong>MUST</strong> be cut from the latest release branch, <strong>NEVER</strong>
                    from develop.
                </li>
                <li><strong>NEVER, EVER,</strong> merge the develop branch to the Ethane Systems release branch.</li>
                <li>Changes go through normal QA process through the "verify" and "validate" steps.</li>
                <li>Developer needs to get code changes approved by a SME.</li>
                <li>Developer sends an email to Sunil to merge the code.</li>
                <li>Someone with access to the release branch will merge the code and let the developer know once it is
                    done.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Start a new feature:</h2>
            <p>Development MUST start from the [release] branch.</p>
            <p class="console">

            <p>Get your feature through verification and validation.</p>
            <p>Get a code review from the appropriate SME.</p>
            <p>Merge your feature back to develop.</p>

            <p><strong>DO NOT DELETE YOUR BRANCH!!!</strong></p>
            <p>Email Sunil to let him know your feature is finished. Be sure to include your branch name.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Sunil will finish your feature:</h2>

                <li>Sunil will email the release notes for the week's release.</li>
                <li>Said release notes will contain the branches that were merged to r-ethane-systems.</li>
